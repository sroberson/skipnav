# skipnav

Skipnav is a vanilla Javascript implementation of ["Skip Navigation" Links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/)

This adds the above described functionality to html links that look like:

&lt;a href="#main" id="skipnav">Skip Navigation&lt;/a>

This means that you must have the **"main"** id on a target in the DOM.

## Vue.js version is included

We've included an example implementation of this code for use in a Vue.js component. This file is called **skipnav-vue.js**
